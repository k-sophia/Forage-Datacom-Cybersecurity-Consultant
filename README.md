Investigate a cyberattack and conduct a comprehensive risk assessment with Datacom.

## Task 1 - APT breach: Analysing The Impact On Information Security

### Scenario
A leading tech corporation client suffered a sophisticated cyberattack by a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as APT34. Believed to be sponsored by a foreign government, the attack compromised the organisation's network and led to theft of valuable customer data and intellectual property.

Conduct research on APT34 and assess the breach's impact on the organisation's information security. Apply the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to develop a defence strategy to protect the client's networks and systems against future attacks.

### Answer the Questions
1. What is the history of APT34?  
2. Which nation/state is APT34 associated with?  
3. Are there specific industries they typically target?  
4. What are their motives?  
5. What TTPs do they employ in their attacks?  
6. What security measures could be implemented to mitigate future risks from this APT?

## Task 2 - Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
Research on the APT34 provides insight into potential attackers, their methods, motives, and targets. This information highlights vulnerabilities and attack vectors that could be exploited.

The client requires a thorough assessment of potential security threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems. While basic perimeter controls are in place, further evaluation is needed to identify additional risks and determine appropriate mitigation strategies.

Conduct a risk assessment for the client to define the context, assess the risk matrix, and identify potential risk scenarios.

### Process Overview
1. **Define the context** – Identify critical assets requiring protection
2. **Define the risk matrix** – Establish the likelihood, consequence, and risk rating for each risk scenario
3. **Identify risk scenarios** – Define at least three scenarios that could threaten the client’s assets
4. **Assess inherent risk** – Calculate the risk rating for each scenario without existing security measures
5. **Assess current risk** – Evaluate the risk rating for each scenario with existing measures in place  
6. **Assess target risk with additional measures** – Identify and assess the impact of additional security controls to further reduce risk
7. **Produce a risk assessment report** – Summarise findings, risk mitigation strategies, and recommended actions to strengthen the client’s security posture
