   - Reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately or after detecting brute force attempts
   - Use Multi-Factor Authentication
   - Use the Principle of Least Privilege
- Harden and Monitor Network 
  - Use network appliances to filter ingress/egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering
  - Network Intrusion Prevention Systems use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware that can be used to mitigate activity at the network level
  - Segmenting the network into smaller, isolated networks
  - Disable unnecessary ports and services
- Employee Training
  - Provide regular cybersecurity awareness training of social engineering tactics
- Incident Response
  - Regularly update incident response plan
